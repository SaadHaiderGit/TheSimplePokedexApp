# Simple Pokedex App

This is a basic Pokedex application for Android that uses PokeAPI. It allows a user to search up 1000+ different species from the *Pokemon* franchise and get some information about them, including different forms, in-game descriptions, and more.

You can test out the app on Android Studio using its in-built emulators. Simply download the git repository, then start running the app from the IDE. 

You can search for Pokemon by entering their species name or their number entry. You'll be able to cycle through alternate forms (if they have any) and their in-game descriptions (if they were present in multiple games).
